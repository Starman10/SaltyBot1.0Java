# SaltyBot1.0Java
A bot designed for Salty Bet. Written in Java.


Try running SaltyBot0.9.jar with Java. This should open the application.
You need to run saltybet in Chrome (fullscreen) for it to work properly. Chrome must remain on top for the program to work since
it takes screenshots to trigger events.
