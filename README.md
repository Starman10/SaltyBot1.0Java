Try running SaltyBot0.9.jar with Java. This should open the application.
If it doesn't open the application make sure your java is up to date.
If it still doesn't work try 

java -jar (filepath)SaltyBot0.9.jar

in CMD as an admin; replace (filepath) with the path you have SatltyBot0.9.jar in
You need to run saltybet in Chrome (fullscreen) for it to work properly. 
Chrome must remain on top for the program to work since
it takes screenshots to trigger events.
